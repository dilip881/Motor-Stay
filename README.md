When we go out, we rarely find a parking spot for vehicles, so we came up with an idea called "Motor Stay." For example, I have a place in my home to park 2 vehicles, but I don't have any vehicles to park. so the place is of no use. At the same time, someone might require space to park but they can't find such space to park their vehicles. So this is where our website comes into play. In order to overcome these situations people can make use of MOTOR STAY by registering their free parking space on our website to rent on an hourly basis and also look for the available parking spaces in their area at the same time. This will help in fixing parking issues, especially in metro cities.
